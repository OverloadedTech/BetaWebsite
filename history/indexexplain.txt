<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">: This line links to an external stylesheet for the Google font 'Roboto'.

<style>...</style>: This section contains inline CSS that styles the HTML document. It globally styles all elements to center the text, set the color to white, set the font to 'Roboto' and set the background color to a dark gray. It also styles the body of the page using flexbox to centrally align the content, and styles the history and GitHub buttons.

<body>: Contains the actual content to be displayed to users.

<h1>History</h1>: This is a top-level header for the page.

<p>Didn't have much time, sorry :(</p>: This paragraph provides a message to users about a lack of time for possibly further content.

<button class="history-btn" onclick="window.location.href='/';">Back to Home</button>: This button, when clicked, navigates the user back to the home page.
